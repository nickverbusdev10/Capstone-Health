Are rates of uninsured people increasing or decreasing?

What is the relationship between rates of insurance coverage and income for US and per state (if available)?

What is the relationship between rates of insurance coverage and wealth inequality for US and for state (if available)?

What is the relationship between rates of insurance coverage and race for US and for state (if available)?

Is insurance coverage increasing for people with lower income at the same rate as it is for people with higher income?

Can we predict if someone is insured based on wealth inequality index of state, their income, and their demographic factors (age, sex, race etc...)?
